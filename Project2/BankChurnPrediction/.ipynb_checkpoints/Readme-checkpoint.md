# Project - BankChurnPrediction

This project focuses on supervised learning for classification tasks using a real-world tabular dataset. The main goal is to explore and train machine learning models to accurately predict whether a bank customer will churn (close the account) or stay.

## How to Run

### 1. Requirements

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### 2. Open the Jupyter Notebook 

Open the terminal on the project directory and type: 

```bash
jupyter notebook 
```
Then you will be redirected to a web browser with the code, you should run the project from there.

## Results

The notebook outputs:
- Evaluation metrics like Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report
- Graphical comparison of model performance
- Exploratory visualizations like bar charts
